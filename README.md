# Fluid Simulation Practice:
I follow the https://github.com/tunabrain/incremental-fluids.git.

It is a fantastic tutorial !

## About my project:
I use almost everything from that project except for two things.

1: I just use stb_image as my image encoding library.

2: I use ffmpeg to produce the video by encoding these images.

Here is a useful link for it:
